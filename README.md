## 📱 Project Overview
**The Last Floor** is a short psychological horror mobile game prototype developed using **React Native with Expo Go**.  
The game takes place inside a malfunctioning elevator trapped between floors in an abandoned building. Each floor introduces subtle environmental changes and narrative clues that challenge the player’s observation and decision-making skills.

Unlike traditional mobile horror games, this project focuses on **atmospheric and psychological tension** rather than jump scares or combat mechanics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Most mobile horror games rely heavily on jump scares or complex controls that are not suitable for touch-based devices.  
This project addresses this issue by providing a minimalistic, immersive horror experience that emphasizes atmosphere, sound design, and player perception.
